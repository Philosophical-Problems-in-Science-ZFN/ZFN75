In this formulation, life (a living individual) is defined as a network of inferior negative feedbacks (regulatory mechanisms) subordinated to (being at service of) a superior positive feedback (potential of expansion). It is suggested that this definition is the minimal definition, necessary and sufficient, for life to be distinguished from inanimate phenomena and, as such, it describes the essence of life. Subsequently, a quantitative expression for the amount of the biologically relevant (“purposeful”) information (as opposed to the amount of information in the thermodynamic sense) is proposed. This is followed by the application of the formulated approach to different phenomena of a dubious status existing presently on the Earth as well as to the process of origination of life on our planet.},

A proper understanding of these terms can be gained from the referenced literature. But more specifically, this book is about the concept of information as physical phenomenon. The book is a unique exposition of the concept of information as physical phenomenon. It provides the detailed analysis and synthesis of the current conceptualizations of information demonstrating the lack of common definition and their incompleteness. The detailed argument is provided why information may be defined as a physical phenomenon and why this type of information may be seen as fundamental to our understanding of this concept"--},

In addition, these studies recognize how a phenomenon that is denoted as physical information can be expressed as an organization of natural or artificial entities.

The verification is based on comparison of the predicted inner state of the autonomous agent, that is the cognitive subject, to the achieved inner state of the agent. The state is achieved as the result of performing the action in the real world—the agent’s environment. The action design is created on the basis of the agent’s model of the world. The truth is defined as the adequacy of the model of the real world in the context of the goal that is assumed to be reached as the effect of the performed action. The concepts of the cognitive subject, the truth bearings and the knowledge are redefined. The classical problems of aletheiology and epistemology are discussed in the light of the proposed approach. The cybernetic construct of an autonomous agent allows the researcher to consider a wide class of cognitive entities, which, in the previous approaches, have been limited only to human beings as cognitive subjects.},

Such analysis allows us to consider the system properties: the level of the autonomy, energy dissipation in the system, the payoff specificity (in the meaning of game theory), functional role of the agents in the system, the level of the agents’ cooperation, and delays in flows of money, requests, rules, and controls. As a result, some new functionalities of the healthcare system on the national level have been found and analysed. The aforementioned parameters are good tools to analyse the system functionality.},

Until now there has been no guidance available on how to make use of the tool for more general purposes. This book lets managers understand the theory and practice of causal mapping in layman's terms for use in both individual and group settings. It shows managers how to develop and use action-oriented strategy maps and logic models in business decision making.

Others also include the level of individual human beings. In contrast to this, many presume that information is everywhere in nature. In this paper, we treat this problem, taking it at a different level of placing information in the structure of the world. Consequently, at first, we describe the global structure of the world and then find the place of information in this structure. In addition, we consider structure of information processes, as well as relations between information and basic constituents of the world, such as matter, energy, mentality and knowledge},

Usually, causal maps are used to cope with this type of interrelationships. However, the classical view of causal maps is based on an intuitive view with ad hoc rules and no precise semantics of the primitive concepts, nor a sound formal treatment of relations between concepts. In this paper, we solve this problem by proposing a formal model for causal maps with a precise semantics based on relation algebra and the software tool, CM-RELVIEW, in which it has been implemented. Then, we investigate the issue of using this tool in multiagent environments by explaining through different examples how and why this tool is useful for the following aspects: 1) the reasoning on agents' subjective views, 2) the qualitative distributed decision making, and 3) the organization of agents considered as a holistic approach. For each of these aspects, we focus on the computational mechanisms developed within CM-RELVIEW to support it.},

For generations, scientists have struggled to make sense of this fundamental question, for life really does look like magic: even a humble bacterium accomplishes things so dazzling that no human engineer can match it. Huge advances in molecular biology over the past few decades have served only to deepen the mystery. In this penetrating and wide-ranging book, world-renowned physicist and science communicator Paul Davies searches for answers in a field so new and fast-moving that it lacks a name; it is a domain where biology, computing, logic, chemistry, quantum physics, and nanotechnology intersect. At the heart of these diverse fields, Davies explains, is the concept of information: a quantity which has the power to unify biology with physics, transform technology and medicine, and force us to fundamentally reconsider what it means to be alive—even illuminating the age-old question of whether we are alone in the universe. From life’s murky origins to the microscopic engines that run the cells of our bodies, The Demon in the Machine journeys across an astounding landscape of cutting-edge science. Weaving together cancer and consciousness, two-headed worms and bird navigation, Davies reveals how biological organisms garner and process information to conjure order out of chaos, opening a window onto the secret of life itself.},

Children's causal learning and inference may involve computations similar to those for learning causal Bayes nets and for predicting with them.

We illustrate its nature by measuring the 22 different organizations of a set of eight things; and we facilitate its use by defining the parameters that determine an amount of organization. The measure is then applied to show that the organization of limb pairs on free-living arthropods, based on data given by Cisne, confirms a pattern of increasing organization in their evolution from the Cambrian era to the present. Further applications measure the changes in organizations of ideal (theoretical) life forms, and contrasting changes in inanimate systems. Our main results represent the reproduction of unicellular organisms, and the formation of hierarchies, as processes of increasing organization.},

We extracted measures capturing umbrella concepts of positive and adaptive states of mental health (i.e., well-being, quality of life, and resilience/coping), the underlying dimensions (e.g., vitality, autonomy) and design features (e.g., response scales). Our search identified 155 measures of positive mental health with a total of 410 constituent dimensions. Using thematic analysis, we consolidated these 410 original dimensions into a set of 21 themes. These themes were transformed into a concept map to illustrate their inter-relationship with the umbrella concepts of positive mental health. Our results demonstrate minimal consensus on the underlying dimensions and measurement approaches for investigating positive mental health, resulting in an unwieldy situation for ongoing scientific study.},

Although useful in one sense, pertaining to scientific understanding, in another, pertaining to the process of scientific thinking, the metaphor may be fundamentally misleading. Research is reviewed indicating that processes of scientific thinking differ significantly in children, lay adults, and scientists. Hence, it is the instruments of scientific thinking, not just the products, that undergo "strong restructuring" (S. Carey; see record 1987-08644-001). A framework for conceptualizing development of scientific thinking processes is proposed, centering on progressive differentiation and coordination of theory and evidence. This development is metacognitive, as well as strategic. It requires thinking about theories, rather than merely with them, and thinking about evidence, rather than merely being influenced by it, and, hence, reflects the attainment of control over the interaction of theories and evidence in one's own thinking.

	abstract = {A research program at Cornell University that sought to study the ability of children to acquire science concepts and the effect of this learning on later schooling led to the need for a new tool to describe explicit changes in children's conceptual understanding. Concept mapping was invented in 1972 to meet this need, and subsequently numerous other uses have been found for this tool. Underlying the research program and the development of the concept mapping tool was an explicit cognitive psychology of learning and an explicit constructivist epistemology. In 1987, collaboration began between Novak and Cañas and others at the Florida Institute for Human and Machine Cognition, then part of the University of West Florida. Extending the use of concept mapping to other applications such as the integration of concept mapping with the World Wide Web (WWW) led to the development of software that enhanced the potential of concept mapping, evolving into the current version of CmapTools now used worldwide in schools, universities, corporations, and governmental and non-governmental agencies. Differences between concept maps and other knowledge representation tools are described. The integration of concept mapping software programs with the WWW and other new technologies permits a new kind of concept map-centred learning environment wherein learners build their own knowledge models, individually or collaboratively, and these can serve as a basis for life-long meaningful learning. Combined with other educational practices, use of CmapTools permits a New Model for Education. Preliminary studies are underway to assess the possibilities of this New Model.},

The current research assessed the content and factor structure variation of ILTs for male and female perceivers (separately and combined) across three stimuli: leaders, effective leaders and supervisors. Results suggest eight distinct factors of ILTs (Sensitivity, Dedication, Tyranny, Charisma, Attractiveness, Masculinity, Intelligence and Strength) that remain relatively stable across both perceiver sex and stimuli. Implicit theories for leaders and effective leaders were typically more favorable than for supervisors. These findings suggest that implicit theories of leadership may vary in systematic ways and underscore the importance of reaching beyond mere recognition of the existence of such theories toward an understanding of variations in both the content and the structure of the implicit ways that people view leaders.},

Even among those who endorse Mentalese, considerable controversy surrounds its representational format. What semantically relevant structure should scientific psychology attribute to Mentalese symbols? Researchers commonly emphasize logical structure, akin to that displayed by predicate calculus sentences. To counteract this tendency, I discuss computational models of navigation drawn from probabilistic robotics. These models involve computations defined over cognitive maps, which have geometric rather than logical structure. They thereby demonstrate the possibility of rational cognitive processes in an exclusively non-logical representational medium. Furthermore, they offer much promise for the empirical study of animal navigation.

	abstract = {Analogy belongs to the class of concepts notorious for a variety of definitions generating continuing disputes about their preferred understanding. Analogy is typically defined by or at least associated with similarity, but as long as similarity remains undefined this association does not eliminate ambiguity. In this paper, analogy is considered synonymous with a slightly generalized mathematical concept of similarity which under the name of tolerance relation has been the subject of extensive studies over several decades. In this approach, analogy can be mathematically formalized in terms of the sequence of binary relations of increased generality, from the identity, equivalence, tolerance, to weak tolerance relations. Each of these relations has cryptomorphic presentations relevant to the study of analogy. The formalism requires only two assumptions which are satisfied in all of the earlier attempts to formulate adequate definitions which met expectations of the intuitive use of the word analogy in general contexts. The mathematical formalism presented here permits theoretical analysis of analogy in the contrasting comparison with abstraction, showing its higher level of complexity, providing a precise methodology for its study and informing philosophical reflection. Also, arguments are presented for the legitimate expectation that better understanding of analogy can help mathematics in establishing a unified and universal concept of a structure.},

In both protein synthesis and in later development, genes are symbols, in that there is no necessary connection between their form (sequence) and their effects. The sequence of a gene has been determined, by past natural selection, because of the effects it produces. In biology, the use of informational terms implies intentionality, in that both the form of the signal, and the response to it, have evolved by selection. Where an engineer sees design, a biologist sees natural selection.},

Two coupled conveying processes, the passing of compact tRNA globules and the drawing of linear mRNA chain through intraribosomal channel, are considered driven by discrete acts of translocation during translation. Instead of mechanical transmission mechanisms and power-stroke ‘motors’, thermal motion and chemically induced changes in affinities of ribosomal binding sites for their ligands (tRNAs, mRNA, elongation factors) are proposed to underlie all the directional movements within the ribosomal complex. The GTP-dependent catalysis of conformational transitions by elongation factors during translation is also discussed.},

In this paper, the information space for multi-sensor networks is developed from information geometry. The relationship between information space and the performance of multi-sensor networks is investigated. Different sensor information obtained by multi-sensor networks is represented, analyzed and fused concisely. The structure of the information space is studied such as geodesic, Ricci tensor and the information metric matrix. The structural properties of the information space are introduced: i) the symmetry; ii) the connection between information space’s curvature and Einstein’s field equation; iii) noise essence conjecture. The proposed analysis techniques are validated in many scenarios. The theoretical demonstration and numerical results indicate that the information described in different coordinate systems is equivalent.},

	abstract = {Cognitive psychological research has produced rich descriptions of the mental representations and processes that underlie performance in many school-related subject matter areas, making it possible to be much more precise than before in our descriptions of the outcomes of learning. Nevertheless, the epistemology of cognitive psychology has not been helpful in providing fruitful hypotheses about the environmental variables that facilitate learning and the acquisition of expertise. For this reason, an applied science of learning developed, where instructional interventions and experiments became the means of developing a theory of learning almost in a trial and error fashion. As we are now evaluating the results of these research findings it becomes obvious that a new theoretical framework is needed to further guide research on learning and instruction. It is argued that such a theoretical framework can be found in cognitive psychology if the original epistemology that guided cognitive psychological research is revised. What is needed is a new conception of the mind, not as an individual information processor, but as a biological, developing system that exists equally well within an individual brain and in the tools, artifacts, and symbolic systems used to facilitate social and cultural interaction. With such a revised epistemology, coupled with the methodology of experimental psychology and of cognitive task analysis, cognitive psychology can be a much more powerful theoretical framework than we ever had before, capable of leading us to new insights about learning and instruction.},

	abstract = {This study was designed to investigate how subject matter knowledge and the use of informal reasoning mechanisms are related to the solving of economics problems by naive individuals (with no formal training in economics) and novice individuals (with training in one or two formal economics courses). The naive groups included individuals having or not having a college education, and both naive and novice groups included individuals having or not having vocational and/or avocational experience related to economics. Participants answered questions about changes in automobile prices, the federal deficit, and interest rates. Individuals with a college education performed better in relation to economics knowledge than those who did not attend college, and little performance difference was observed between those college educated individuals who did and those who did not have formal economics training and/or relevant experience. The results suggest that classroom instruction in economics does not necessarily lead to superior performance on "everyday" economics tasks and that individuals with a strong intellectual history may not acquire economics knowledge from everyday experience. In addition, application of a model of informal reasoning indicates that college educated individuals differ from those with no college education in (a) quality of problem representation; (b) use of qualifiers, counterarguments, and metastatements; and (c) recovering from argument distortion. Findings are discussed in relation to subject matter learning.},
