Azzouni illustrates what the metaphysical landscape looks like once we avoid a militant Realism which forces our commitment to anything that our theories quantify. Escaping metaphysical straitjackets (such as the correspondence theory of truth), while retaining the insight that some truths are about objects that do exist, Azzouni says that we can sort scientifically-given objects into two categories: ones which exist, and to which we forge instrumental access in order to learn their properties, and ones which do not, that is, which are made up in exactly the same sense that fictional objects are. He offers as a case study a small portion of Newtonian physics, and one result of his classification of its ontological commitments, is that it does not commit us to absolute space and time.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Model theory is used in every theoretical branch of analytic philosophy: in philosophy of mathematics, in philosophy of science, in philosophy of language, in philosophical logic, and in metaphysics. But these wide-ranging appeals to model theory have created a highly fragmented literature. On the one hand, many philosophically significant results are found only in mathematics textbooks: these are aimed squarely at mathematicians; they typically presuppose that the reader has a serious background in mathematics; and little clue is given as to their philosophical significance. On the other hand, the philosophical applications of these results are scattered across disconnected pockets of papers. The first aim of this book, then, is to consider the philosophical uses of model theory, focusing on the central topics of reference, realism, and doxology. Its second aim is to address important questions in the philosophy of model theory, such as: sameness of theories and structure, the boundaries of logic, and the classification of mathematical structures. Philosophy and Model Theory will be accessible to anyone who has completed an introductory logic course. It does not assume that readers have encountered model theory before, but starts right at the beginning, discussing philosophical issues that arise even with conceptually basic model theory. Moreover, the book is largely self-contained: model-theoretic notions are defined as and when they are needed for the philosophical discussion, and many of the most philosophically significant results are given accessible proofs.},

Recently, Jody Azzouni, Joseph Melia, and Stephen Yablo have argued (in different ways) that it is a mistake to read our ontological commitments simply from what the quantifiers of our best scientific theories range over. In this paper, I argue that all three arguments fail and they fail for much the same reason; would-be nominalists are thus left facing Field’s hard road.},

	abstract = {For most mathematicians and many mathematical physicists the name Erich Kähler is strongly tied to important geometric notions such as Kähler metrics, Kähler manifolds and Kähler groups. They all go back to a paper of 14 pages written in 1932. This, however, is just a small part of Kähler's many outstanding achievements which cover an unusually wide area: From celestial mechanics he got into complex function theory, differential equations, analytic and complex geometry with differential forms, and then into his main topic, i.e. arithmetic geometry where he constructed a system of notions which is a precursor and, in large parts, equivalent to the now used system of Grothendieck and Dieudonné. His principal interest was in finding the unity in the variety of mathematical themes and establishing thus mathematics as a universal language. In this volume Kähler's mathematical papers are collected following a "Tribute to Herrn Erich Kähler" by S. S. Chern, an overview of Kähler's life data by A. Bohm and R. Berndt, and a Survey of his Mathematical Work by the editors. There are also comments and reports on the developments of the main topics of Kähler's work, starting by W. Neumann's paper on the topology of hypersurface singularities, J.-P. Bourguignon's report on Kähler geometry and, among others by Berndt, Bost, Deitmar, Ekeland, Kunz and Krieg, up to A. Nicolai's essay "Supersymmetry, Kähler geometry and Beyond". As Kähler's interest went beyond the realm of mathematics and mathematical physics, any picture of his work would be incomplete without touching his work reaching into other regions. So a short appendix reproduces three of his articles concerning his vision of mathematics as a universal Theme together with an essay by K. Maurin giving an "Approach to the philosophy of Erich Kähler".},

We present an analogue of the “magic correspondence” for the spinor representation of Minkowski space and show how the Hall matrices fit into the scheme.

            Recent work on formal theories of truth has revived an approach, due originally to Tarski, on which syntax and truth theories are sharply distinguished—‘disentangled’—from mathematical base theories. In this paper, we defend a novel philosophical constraint on disentangled theories. We argue that these theories must be epistemically stable: they must possess an intrinsic motivation justifying no strictly stronger theory. In a disentangled setting, even if the base and the syntax theory are individually stable, they may be jointly unstable. We contend that this flaw afflicts many proposals discussed in the literature; we defend a new, stable disentangled theory, double second-order arithmetic.},

We also further examine the relation of such hypothesized identity of quantum entities to the Principle of the Identity of Indiscernibles.

              Although complex numbers are essential in mathematics, they are not needed to describe physical experiments, as those are expressed in terms of probabilities, hence real numbers. Physics, however, aims to explain, rather than describe, experiments through theories. Although most theories of physics are based on real numbers, quantum theory was the first to be formulated in terms of operators acting on complex Hilbert spaces
              1,2
              . This has puzzled countless physicists, including the fathers of the theory, for whom a real version of quantum theory, in terms of real operators, seemed much more natural
              3
              . In fact, previous studies have shown that such a ‘real quantum theory’ can reproduce the outcomes of any multipartite experiment, as long as the parts share arbitrary real quantum states
              4
              . Here we investigate whether complex numbers are actually needed in the quantum formalism. We show this to be case by proving that real and complex Hilbert-space formulations of quantum theory make different predictions in network scenarios comprising independent states and measurements. This allows us to devise a Bell-like experiment, the successful realization of which would disprove real quantum theory, in the same way as standard Bell experiments disproved local physics.},

In particular, the (projective) real quadric Qp,q = (Sp × Sq)/Z2 is associated, in this manner, with the flat space Rp+q endowed with a metric tensor of signature (p, q). For p and q positive, the quadric Qp,q is orientable iff p + q is even. The quadric has two natural metrics, invariant with respect to the action of O(p + 1) × O(q + 1): a proper Riemannian one and a pseudo-Riemannian metric of signature (p,q). This paper contains an explicit description of spin structures on real, even-dimensional quadrics for both metrics, whenever these structures exist. In particular, it is shown that, for p and q even positive, the proper (pseudo-Riemannian) metric gives rise to two inequivalent spin structures iff p + q ≡ 2 (mod 4) (p + q ≡ 0 (mod 4)). If p and q are odd and {\textgreater} 1, then there is no spin structure for their metric whenever p + q ≡ 0 (mod 4); otherwise, there are two spin structures for each of the metrics. There always exist spin structures on real quadrics with a Lorentzian metric, i.e., when p and q are odd and p or q = 1.},

There are, however, interesting generalizations of twistor ideas to other dimensions and signatures; especially to proper Riemannian 3- and 4-manifolds.
